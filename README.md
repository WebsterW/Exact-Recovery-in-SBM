================================================================================

This package contains 2 experimental tests to output the results in the paper:

* In the folder named phase transition, we conduct the expriment of phase transition to test recovery performance of our approach GPM and compare it with  SDP-based approach in Amini et al. (2018), the manifold optimization (MFO) based approach in Bandeira et al. (2016), and the spectral clustering (SC) approach in Abbe et al. (2017).
